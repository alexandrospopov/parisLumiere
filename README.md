 ## Introduction
 
 During the course of Data Visualisation we were given the opportunity to design an interactive data exploration tool. 
 
 For us, is was foremost a way to dig into data exploration and tool designing. We wanted to choose a subject that would provide rich data and would match our personal interests. 
 Quickly, we noticed that we shared an interest in Cinema and we really focused in this field. 
 
 One dataset that we liked instantly was the Paris Movie Shooting Records. It provided us with the basic data of every shot made in Paris in 2016. Choosing a movie, we were able to see where it has been shot in Paris. 
 
 So many questions we could finally answer ! What movies have been shot close to my work or my home ? Where are the movies shot in winter and in spring ? Are movies only in touristic areas ? Where are shot the best movies in Paris ? Does any director know about my most romantic spot in Paris ..? 
 
 The decision had been made : we would design a tool to discover how directors see our dear City of Lights.
